This project demonstrates a sales analysis using Power BI connected to a MySQL database. The steps involved in the project are detailed below:

# Project Workflow

## Data Extraction:
- Connect Power BI to a MySQL database to extract the sales transaction data.

## Data Transformation:
- Use Power Query in Power BI to clean and transform the data.
- Standardize sales transactions recorded in different currencies (INR and USD) by adding a new column to convert all values to the same currency.

## Data Loading:
- Load the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI for analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visualization:
- Calculate measures such as revenue and sales quantity.
- Visualize revenue and sales quantity by markets.
- Identify the top five customers and products based on revenue.
- Create a line chart to display the revenue trend over time.
- Use slicers to filter the charts by year and month for detailed analysis.

## Key Visualizations
- Revenue by Market: A visualization showing revenue distribution across different markets.
- Sales Quantity by Market: A visualization depicting the sales quantity across different markets.
- Top Five Customers and Products: Identifying the top five customers and products based on revenue.
- Revenue Trend: A line chart to visualize the revenue trend over a specified period.
- Slicers: Slicers to filter and analyze the data year-wise and month-wise.

## Tools Used
- Power BI: For data extraction, transformation, loading, and visualization.
- MySQL: As the data source for the sales transactions.
